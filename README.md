## About

Dream World was a modification of [Eclipse Origins](https://github.com/RobinPerris/EclipseOrigins), an open-source ORPG made in VB6. It was designed to allow people with no programming knowledge to make their own online persistent world RPG.

## How to use

Dream World was discontinued in 2013. As such, the best way to find resources you need is to use the Way Back Machine to find active pages on the Eclipse Origins website from 2008 - 2013.

Here are a few to get you started on Eclipse Origins that also works on Dream World:
